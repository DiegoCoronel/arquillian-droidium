== Tests for Arquillian Droidium

This project shows various use cases of Arquillian Droidium container 
possibly cooperating with native and web extensions.

All necessary configuration needed in order to execute tests can be 
found in every project README separately.

It contains these modules as standalone projects:

=== arquillian-droidium-multiple-containers-test-01

This project tests a scenario when multiple container adapters are on the classpath,
which is not normally possible. It starts Android emulator of given AVD 
(or it is connected to it when such emulator is already running) and 
it starts / connects to JBoss AS 7.1.1 as well. This project does not 
use any additional plugins at all.

=== arquillian-droidium-multiple-containers-test-02

This project tests a scenario when you are using two Android containers - each of different versions 
and you are executing the same test cases. It is shown as for a completeness and as a proof it is possible.
You would normally use simple test with one AVD as with -native-test-01 but you woud execute it twice - each 
time with different AVD specified.

=== arquillian-droidium-native-test-01

Tests test application from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project. 
Internally, it repackages selendroid server according to application under test dynamically, 
then it installs it with test application. The instrumentation of application under test is 
executed (instrumentation is done by repackaged selendroid server) and testing is performed.

This project uses `arquillian-droidium-native` extension which does just mentioned. It uses 
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Drone[Arquillian Drone Web Driver].

=== arquillian-droidium-web-test-01

Tests helloworld-like application which is deployed into JBoss AS and tests 
are performed in connection with WebDriver and Arquillian Graphene. Tests are 
executed against Android device - browser on Android device is started and 
functional tests are executed there.
