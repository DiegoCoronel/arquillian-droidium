== Arquillian Droidium native test - SelendroidDriver

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd=name_of_avd`

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project and it uses
for the first time `SelendroidDriver` from Selendroid project. `SelendroidDriver` is injected into test because of 
implemented Selendroid driver extension for Arquillian Drone. This extension is placed in `droidium-native` 
module under `arquillian-droidium-native-selendroid-driver` directory so you are good to use native depchain as you 
are used to. The information about the configuration of Selendroid driver extension can be found in the implementation directory 
of the extension itself.

You have to have `jarsigner`, `keytool` and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
