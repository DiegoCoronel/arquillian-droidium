== Arquillian Droidium web test

To build the application, simply execute `mvn clean package`. Tests are skipped.

When application is built, execute test profile like this:

`mvn test -Pandroid-test -Dip.jboss=x.y.z.w -Dname.avd=android-4.1.2`

All arguments have to be specified.

* `ip.jboss` - is external IP address of your localhost where you 
want your JBoss AS instance to hook. This has to be external IP since localhost address will not be 
accessible for Android device - it will be localhost of Android device itself and not of your host 
where web app is running.
* `name.avd` - name of AVD you want to execute tests on.

JBoss AS container is automatically downloaded for you into `target` so you do not have to 
managed your JBoss instance on your own. Please be sure there is not any JBoss AS container already 
running before execution of tests.
