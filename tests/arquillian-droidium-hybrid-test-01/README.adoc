== Arquillian Droidium hybrid test - SelendroidDriver

When you are executing tests, you have to set name of (possibly started) AVD
you want to use for test executions. You _have to_ provide this information 
for Maven otherwise tests will fail.

This test shows how hybrid (native + web) applications can be tested in one test run 
and how switching between native and web mode is done.

`mvn clean test -Dname.avd=name_of_avd`

This tests uses Selendroid server APK from http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/[Selendroid] project.

You have to have `jarsigner`, `keytool` and so on in your system. You are usually good with default JDK installation.
You should have these commands in `$JAVA_HOME`.
